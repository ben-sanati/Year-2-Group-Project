The repository contains libraries to use for the heart rate sensor along with a sample.

To use the libraries heartrate.cpp and heartrate.h need to be put in documents/arduino/libraries.

final_version.ino is a simple demonstration of the heart rate monitor working.

Other files have been used at previous stages of development and shouldn't be used now
