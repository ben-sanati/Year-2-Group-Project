## Problem Statement
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many companies to shift to remote work to ensure the safety of their employees. While remote work has its advantages, it also presents challenges in promoting physical activity and wellness among employees. Without the structure of an office environment and the ability to engage in physical activities with colleagues, employees may find it difficult to maintain an active lifestyle. This can lead to negative health outcomes and decreased productivity.

To address this issue, our team was tasked with developing a system that promotes remote physical activity among employees during the COVID-19 lockdown. The system should provide resources and support for employees to engage in physical activity while working from home. It should also foster a sense of community and encourage employees to participate in group activities and challenges. Ultimately, the goal is to improve the health and well-being of employees while maintaining productivity during the challenging times.

## Team Solution
Our prototype solution, `Abor.io`, has been designed to address the issues of company employeesâ€™ mental and physical wellbeing by encouraging remote physical activity in groups. Our system encourages simultaneous activity by giving rewards for joint workouts, providing a competitive yet friendly platform for employees to interact upon and maintain their employee relationships.
