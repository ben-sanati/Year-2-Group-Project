Source code and files used for the local version of the website.

The images folder holds the image files used in the webpages.
The Learning folder holds sample code (created by Ben).

companyDonations.html, loginPage.html, myTree.html and ourGarden.html are the source files.
These files are not directly used in our final solution. The server has taken the html files and adapted them into the server.
